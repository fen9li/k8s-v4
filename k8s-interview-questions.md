## What is a Kubernetes namespace?
The Kubernetes namespace is used in the environment wherein we have multiple users spread in the geographically vast areas and working on multiple projects. What the namespace does is dividing the cluster resources between multiple users.

## What is a pod in Kubernetes?
We can think of Kubernetes pod as a group of containers that are run on the same host. So, if we regularly deploy single containers, then our container and the pod will be one and the same.
